1. **Display Metadata (ExifTool):**
   - The option to display metadata is implemented with `exiftool`.
   - Users can input the file path, and the metadata is displayed interactively.

2. **Embed or Extract Hidden Data (Steghide):**
   - The script allows users to embed hidden data into an image or extract it from an image using `steghide`.
   - It supports input for the container file, data file, and passphrase.

3. **Convert Image Formats (ImageMagick):**
   - Users can convert JPEG images to PNG format using the `convert` command from ImageMagick.

4. **Encrypt Files Securely (OpenSSL):**
   - Includes functionality for encrypting and decrypting files with OpenSSL using AES-256-CBC.

### Installation Process in Your README:
The script assumes that the dependencies (`exiftool`, `steghide`, `imagemagick`, `openssl`) are pre-installed, matching your installation instructions in the README.

### Usage of Command-Line Interface:
The script provides an intuitive, menu-based, command-line interface that mirrors the "Swiss Army knife" utility described in your README. Each functionality is accessible via numbered options, keeping it user-friendly.

### Suggestions for Improvements:
If you want the script to better reflect the polish and usability suggested by your README, we could:
- Add error handling for missing dependencies or incorrect user inputs.
- Implement logging for user actions or outputs (e.g., a log file to record metadata extractions or encryption processes).
- Provide help text or a `--help` flag for users who prefer to see usage instructions upfront.
